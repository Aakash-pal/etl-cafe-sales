# üìä SQL-Only ETL: Cafe Sales Data Cleanup

This project demonstrates a **pure SQL ETL pipeline** for cleaning and transforming raw caf√© transaction data. It uses PostgreSQL and DBeaver, showcasing advanced SQL skills including conditional logic, staging layers, type casting, and validation.

---

## üìÅ Dataset

- **Source:** `dirty_cafe_sales.csv`
- **Rows:** 10,000
- **Issues:** Contains `"ERROR"`, `"UNKNOWN"`, `NULL`, and untyped values across several fields.

---

## üß± SQL Pipeline Structure

| Stage | Table/View | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Raw Load | `raw_cafe_sales` | Imported directly from CSV (all columns as `TEXT`) |
| Repair Layer | `staging_cafe_sales` | Applies conditional `CASE` logic to repair fields like `item` |
| Cleaned View | `cleaned_cafe_sales` *(coming next)* | Final type-cast and validated output |

---

## ‚úÖ What‚Äôs Completed

### Week 1: Raw Load

- Created `raw_cafe_sales` table
- Imported all 10,000 rows using DBeaver
- Verified structure and data shape

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM raw_cafe_sales;
SELECT * FROM raw_cafe_sales LIMIT 5;

### Week 2: Intelligent Repair Layer
- Created staging_cafe_sales using CREATE TABLE AS SELECT

- Repaired invalid item values using contextual CASE logic

- Verified that rows matching "Cake" logic were properly filled

- 869 rows remain with unresolved item values for future review


### ‚úÖ Week 2: Contextual Item Repair (Expanded)

- Expanded the `CASE` logic in `staging_cafe_sales` to cover additional `item` categories:
  - `Cake`, `Coffee`, `Cookie`, `Juice`, `Salad`, `Sandwich`, `Smoothie`, `Tea`
- Logic uses combinations of:
  - `price_per_unit`, `payment_method`, and `location`
- Cleaned rows based on price-based inference
- Remaining rows with ambiguous or invalid `item` values: **724**
- These will be investigated later for deeper repair or filtering

#### Sample CASE logic:
```sql
CASE
  WHEN (item IS NULL OR item IN ('UNKNOWN', 'ERROR', ''))
       AND price_per_unit = '2.0'
       AND payment_method IN (...) 
       AND location IN (...) 
  THEN 'Coffee'
  ...
### üß™ Week 2.5: Quantity Column Repair (Contextual)

- Identified 479 rows with invalid `quantity` values: `'ERROR'`, `'UNKNOWN'`, or blank.
- Further narrowed to 441 rows where:
  - `price_per_unit` and `total_spent` are valid (numeric)
  - Formula: `quantity = total_spent / price_per_unit` holds true

#### SQL Analysis:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM staging_cafe_sales
WHERE quantity IN ('UNKNOWN', '', 'ERROR')
  AND price_per_unit NOT IN ('UNKNOWN', '', 'ERROR')
  AND total_spent NOT IN ('UNKNOWN', '', 'ERROR');
  
### üß™ Week 2.6: Quantity Column Repair (Calculated Logic)

- Identified 479 rows where `quantity` was invalid: `'ERROR'`, `'UNKNOWN'`, or blank.
- Further narrowed to 441 rows where:
  - `price_per_unit` and `total_spent` were valid
  - `quantity` could be derived using:
    ```sql
    quantity = total_spent / price_per_unit
    ```

- Updated the staging layer to include a new `CASE` expression for `quantity`:
    - Replaced dirty values with the calculated result (rounded to integer)
    - Preserved clean values by casting directly
    - Remaining dirty rows (`38`) left as `NULL` for now (due to insufficient info)

#### ‚úÖ Validated with:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM staging_cafe_sales WHERE quantity IS NULL;  -- Result: 38
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM staging_cafe_sales WHERE quantity IS NOT NULL;  -- Successfully repaired remainder

### üíµ Week 2.7: Price Per Unit Repair (Calculated Logic)

- Identified rows where `price_per_unit` was missing or invalid (`NULL`, `'ERROR'`, `'UNKNOWN'`)there were 533 rows
- For rows with valid `quantity` and `total_spent`, calculated missing values using: after which the count is 479 rows
  
  ```sql
  price_per_unit = total_spent / quantity
